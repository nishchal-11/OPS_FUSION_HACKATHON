## 🔧 **Step 3: Troubleshooting Mobile Issues**

### **🚨 If Mobile Can't Access the URLs:**

#### **Check Network Connection:**
```bash
# From your computer, test if mobile can reach it:
ping 192.168.99.173
```

#### **Common Solutions:**
1. **Same WiFi Network:** Ensure phone and computer are on the same WiFi
2. **Windows Firewall:** Temporarily disable or add exception for Python/Streamlit
3. **Mobile Hotspot:** If WiFi fails, try creating hotspot from phone and connect computer
4. **Alternative IP:** Try 127.0.0.1 if on same device, or check other network adapters

### **🎙️ If Mobile Recording Doesn't Work:**

#### **Microphone Permission Issues:**
- **Chrome Mobile:** Usually works best
- **Safari iOS:** May require HTTPS (see HTTPS section below)
- **Firefox Mobile:** Usually works but may need refresh

#### **No Audio Level Indicators:**
- Refresh page and try again
- Check if another app is using microphone
- Try closing other browser tabs
- Grant microphone permission explicitly in browser settings

### **📱 If Mobile Interface Looks Wrong:**
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Check if JavaScript is enabled
- Zoom out if interface is too large

## 🔒 **HTTPS Setup (If Needed for iOS Safari)**

Some iOS devices require HTTPS for microphone access. If needed:

### **Option 1: Using Cloudflared (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download cloudflared, then:
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8502
```
Use the HTTPS URL it provides on your mobile device.

### **Option 2: Using ngrok**
```bash
# Install ngrok, then:
ngrok http 8502
