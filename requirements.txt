# STREAMLIT CLOUD COMPATIBLE - PYTHON 3.13 SUPPORT
# Using TensorFlow Lite ONLY (no full TensorFlow)
# TensorFlow Lite is built-in to Python 3.13 and works great for inference

# Streamlit Web Framework
streamlit>=1.28.0,<1.50.0

# Core ML & Numeric - Works with Python 3.13 (with pre-built wheels)
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.1.0
scipy>=1.11.0,<1.12.0  # Avoid 1.13.x which requires build from source

# Audio Processing - Stable versions with pre-built wheels for Python 3.13
librosa>=0.9.0,<0.11.0
soundfile>=0.12.0,<0.13.0
audioread>=3.0.0,<4.0.0

# Visualization - Compatible versions
matplotlib>=3.7.0,<4.0.0
seaborn>=0.12.0,<0.14.0

# QR Code with PIL support
qrcode>=7.4.0,<8.0.0
Pillow>=10.0.0,<12.0.0

# Utilities

tqdm>=4.65.0,<5.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0,<2.0.0
requests>=2.31.0,<3.0.0

# Core dependencies for functionality
pandas>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0,<1.6.0

# Optional: Lightweight TensorFlow Lite Runtime (Python 3.13 compatible, ~40MB)
# tflite-runtime>=2.13.0  # Uncomment if needed, but usually not required on Streamlit Cloud

# NOTE: NO tensorflow package - using TensorFlow Lite which is built-in
# Models are .tflite format which don't need full TensorFlow
# For Python 3.13: TensorFlow has no wheels, so we avoid it completely
